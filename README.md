# Disease_prediction_using_ML
Project that extensively deals with creation of a Disease Prediction app based on thr given input symptoms.
Basically we use Python language here to train our disease prediction model using ML, this model is trained by set of label input data which contains various symptoms and also their respective disease.
After ttraining the model we thrive to make the model work up to its best accuracy(varies between 0 to 1), once we build a highly accurate model we then tend to design an API that helps to load the user interface that is to be used by our disease prediction model, using this API we move forward to build a disease prediction app based on given input of symptoms.
